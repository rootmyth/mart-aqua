# Martin's Aquarium NSS Project

Hello!  Together, these files create a website for a fictional client who wants to display his exotic aquarium fish online.  The main goal of the project was to gain confidence using the flex-box model in CSS, and to expand general HTML and CSS skills.  The wesite responds well to various browser sizes and beautifully showcases each of the client's prized aquatic friends.  Of course, the tone is intentionally humorous (Dudus Wheresmycarius is not a real scientific name for any animal) and I made the header logo myself.
